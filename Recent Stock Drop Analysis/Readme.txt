This script analyses stocks to identify recent price drops relative to their lower Bollinger Bands and ranks them based on various factors. Hereâ€™s what it does:

The script reads stock ticker symbols from two files (SNP500.txt and FTSE250.txt) into a combined list. For each stock ticker, it downloads historical stock data and calculates technical indicators: RSI (Relative Strength Index), Bollinger Bands, and ATR (Average True Range). It identifies the latest date when the stock's closing price dropped below the lower Bollinger Band and records RSI and ATR values for that date.

The stocks are then sorted by the latest drop date, and the top 25 stocks are selected. Linear regression is performed on the closing prices of these top stocks to get regression metrics (slope and intercept). The stocks are ranked based on these metrics and other factors.

Finally, the script prompts the user to input a stock ticker to generate a detailed report, showing price trends, Bollinger Bands, and a regression line.

This script helps identify and rank stocks that have recently dropped in price relative to their lower Bollinger Bands, providing insights for potential investment opportunities.
